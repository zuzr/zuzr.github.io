# Excercise 1

This exercise will give some practice writing HTML markup and utilizing different types of HTML elements. In this exercise, you will only need to make additions to the `index.html` file based on the instructions below.

This exercise will be graded based on how many of the below steps you complete correctly. If every step is completed correctly, you will get 100%. For each step missed, 10% will be removed, with the lowest score being 60% if you miss more than 4 but still attempt them all.

In this exercise, you will build a barebones HTML webpage for a practice portfolio piece of your choosing.

(TIP: VSCode command to wrap text: alt + z)

Don't worry about which project you choose, you can write about a big project you did last quarter, the food you cooked last night, or any other project you want to show off. This is just practice.

For this webpage, you are required to have:

1. A [title](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) for the page. (This would be shown in the top of the browser and in search engines like google if put online).

2. Metadata that specifies that you are the [author] of this work.(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta)

3. A [top level heading] with the title of the page (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)

4. An [image] of something that has to do with the project. You need to place this image in the `images` subdirectory of the folder this exercise is in. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)

You need to specify the `src` attribute on this image and use a **relative path** to show the image. More information on this is in chapter 2 of the "Interneting is hard" book and in the above link.

You also need to use an `alt` attribute and give a description of the image. This will make the image readable by screen readers and search indexers.

5. A [paragraph] that gives a short overview of the project.

6. A [second level heading] titled "Process", or something along those lines

7. An [ordered list] with the steps you took in your project.

8. Another [second level heading] titled "What I learned", or something along those lines

9. An [unordered list] with some of the things you learned from this project.

10. Finally, thank the reader for reading and include some contact information using an [anchor] to hyperlink to either your portfolio website and/or your email (there is specific protocol for linking emails, check out the link and test it out yourself to make sure its working) (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)

This page is going to look boring, thats the point! HTML is all about semantics, structure, and content. You will learn more about how to make this page beautiful after we learn some css basics later.

Also, feel free to add more to this page. We will be looking for the 10 things above, but you should add more to it to make it feel like a complete webpage. Just make sure you are using semantically correct html. You can validate your HTML here: https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html
