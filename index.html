        Hello.
        This page documents the process and results of a pretty good frisbee throw I made earlier today.

        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        Earlier today my friend Nate got off the phone with a mutual friend of ours, Karl, who was in town for a short time period and wanted to throw a frisbee around. Nate asked if I wanted to join them and I obliged. Karl arrived punctually and we grabbed a disc and walked down the street to Ravenna park. It was a beautiful day and I would have enjoyed the experience even if my frisbee throws were not very good, but over the course of the session there was one throw that stood out to me as pretty good.

        <h3> Process </h3>
        I consider myself mediocre at frisbee throwing but I am familiar with the basics. I am much better throwing in the "normal" across-body fashion, but can occasionally succeed underhand or over the shoulder.

        I decided to go with an underhand grip for this particular throw, and took the following steps in execution:

        <ol>
            <li> Place index and middle fingers of right hand inside the rim of the disc </li>
            <li> Tuck rim closest to the hand within the nook of the thumb </li>
            <li> Locate target (Karl) and adjust stance, left foot in front of right </li>
            <li> Rear back the right arm </li>
            <li> Lead with the elbow, then the wrist </li>
            <li> Flick the wrist in a direction that is parallel with the plane of the disc </li>
            <li> Success </li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Results </h3>

        Upon being thrown, the frisbee had adequate angular momentum and the plane of the frisbee was at least somewhat tangent to that of the Earth's surface. The frisbee flew with a slight pitch, creating a cool-looking arc in the sky. It then reached its target with little movement required on Karl's part, and so I regard this throw as pretty good.

        This practice in athleticism taught me a few things:

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li> I am at least average at frisbee-throwing </li>
            <li> The grip I used is viable for creating a pretty good frisbee throw </li>
            <li> Seeking joy in simple things is rewarding </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Conclusion </h3>

        Frisbee throwing is harder than it looks so it is best not to expect success without sufficient experience and training. I treat this as a metaphor for life, as goals are only accomplished with the right amount of effort and resources. If I were to change anything about this frisbee-throwing session, I would likely choose someone other than Karl to chuck disc with because we have beef and looking at his stupid face was slightly detrimental to my experience.
